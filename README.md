# Random Quote Generator

Link: https://nisu-randomquotegenerator.herokuapp.com/

This is website that generates any random quote along with its author.
I have created this using REACT and its part of freeCodeCamp Project.

It is simply just a learning project which fetches an API and serves the quotes randomly.

To run this app simply run the following commands:

```ruby
  npm start
```
